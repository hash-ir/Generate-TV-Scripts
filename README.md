# Generate TV Scripts
This repository is my solution to `Project 3` of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). In this project, I built a Recurrent Neural Network architecture which learns scripts from 9 seasons of the [Seinfeld](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) dataset and generates a new "fake" TV Script based on the same format. 

## Model
* 2 layer uni-directional LSTM with embeddings (learned during the training)

## Sample generated script
> jerry: what about me?<br>jerry: i don't have to wait.<br>kramer:(to the sales table)<br>elaine:(to jerry) hey, look at this, i'm a good doctor.<br>newman:(to elaine) you think i have no idea of this...<br>elaine: oh, you better take the phone, and he was a little nervous.<br>kramer:(to the phone) hey, hey, jerry, i don't want to be a little bit.(to kramer and jerry) you can't.<br>jerry: oh, yeah. i don't even know, i know.<br>jerry:(to the phone) oh, i know.<br>kramer:(laughing) you know...(to jerry) you don't know.
