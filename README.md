# Generate TV Scripts
This repository is my solution to `Project 3` of Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). In this project, I built a Recurrent Neural Network architecture which learns scripts from 9 seasons of the [Seinfeld](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) dataset and generates a new "fake" TV Script based on the same format. 

## Model
* 2 layer uni-directional LSTM with embeddings (learned during the training)
